# Color-Name-Detection-with-Audio-Using-Python
Here it detects the color and gives the audio of that color by taking image through webcam or specified image path.

Colour detection is the process of detecting the name of any color.It seems very
easy. Well, for humans this is an extremely easy task but for computers, it is not
straightforward. Human eyes and brains work together to translate light into color. Light
receptors that are present in our eyes transmit the signal to the brain. Our brain then
recognizes the color. Since childhood, we have mapped certain lights with their color
names. We will be using the somewhat same strategy to detect color names.
ln this color detection Python project, we are going to build an application through which
you can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them. So for this, we will
have a data file that contains the color name and its values. Then we will calculate the
distance from each color and find the shortest one.
Text to speech (TTS) is a useful technology that converts any text into speech 
signal.It can be utilized for various purposes.you just have to sit down and type 
what you want to hear.TTS Reader is a TTS system that allows you to read RTF or TXT 
files out loud and save them for MP3 or WAV files.It proves to be useful for when you 
need to tune in to archieve while performing multiple tasks.Here we used gTTS 
API.gTTS is a very easy to use tool which converts the text entered ,into audio which can 
be saved as a mp3 file.
	Here in our project we merge these projects as one which will convert detected 
color and its RGB values text format into audio format which help people to know which 
color it is with out seeing that color. 
Prerequisites:
Before starting with this Python project with source code, you should be familiar with
the computer vision library of Python that is OpenCV and Pandas.
OpenCV, Pandas, and numpy are the Python packages that are necessary for this project
in Python.
